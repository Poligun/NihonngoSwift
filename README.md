# NihonngoSwift
This is my first iOS project using Swift. It's basically an app that helps me learn Japanese.

#About 
Online contents are fetched from Hujiang Online Dictionary using this url: http://dict.hjenglish.com/jp/jc/. I would
give my thanks to Hujiang for allowing me to remember Japanese words in an easier way.
This app is built only for my personal use.
